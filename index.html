        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a motivated student currently studying <em>Interactive Media Design</em>. 
            I enjoy learning how websites are built and how technology can be used to solve real-world problems. 
            My goal is to improve my technical skills while also developing creativity. 
            I believe consistency is the key to success, and I always try to improve myself every day.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of my studies, I like exploring new ideas and learning about different cultures. 
            I am interested in design, technology, and personal development. 
            I strongly believe that small daily efforts can lead to big achievements over time. 
            My ambition is to build a career where creativity and innovation work together.
